## Getting Started
- A mini Pokedex clone. It is used to find and look up information about a specific pokemon. 

## Built With
- Pokemon API
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- Flask

## Challenges & Next Steps  
- This application can render only 20 pokemon at a time. 
- Looking to find a way to fetch all pokemon so users can search for a specific pokemon outside of the 20 that are rendered on the corresponding page.
